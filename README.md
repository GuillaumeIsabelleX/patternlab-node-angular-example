# Pattern Lab Node - Angular Example

Answering the question, []"does Pattern Lab “not mix well” with Angular?"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39515130/does-pattern-lab-not-mix-well-with-angular)

Yes this example is a bit contrived and reductive, but it is aimed to demonstrate that the two technologies are not wholesale blanket do-you-speak-to-your-mother-with-that-mouth incompatible.

To View the example:

1. Download or Clone
2. `npm install`
3. `gulp patternlab:serve`

For best instructions, I suggest you read through the [gulp edition docs](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node-gulp/).
